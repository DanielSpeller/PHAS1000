A diode is a two-terminal device that allows current to flow primarily in one direction. It is formed by joining p-type and n-type.

The relationship between current and voltage for a diode is given by
$$I=I_{s}(e^{\frac{V}{nV_{t}}}-1)$$
where:
- $I_s$ - Saturation current
- $V_{T}$  - Thermal voltage
- $n$ - Ideality factor

Forward Bias - When the p=side is connected to a positive voltage and vice versa
- The depletion region narrows as electrons and holes recombine
- A forward current flows if applied voltage > threshold voltage
Reverse Bias - When the p=side is connected to a negative voltage and vice versa
- The depletion region widens inhibiting current
- If reverse voltage > breakdown voltage significant current flows damaging resistor
