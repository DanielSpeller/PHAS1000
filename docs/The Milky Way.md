In optical light the Milky Way delineates the plane of our Galaxy

On a map of the milky way
- Bulge is about 1 kpc in radius 
- Bar is about 4 kpc in length 
- Sun is 8 kpc from the centre 
- Disc has a radius of about 20 kpc

Spiral arms delineated by massive star formation
• Distances via their Doppler shift and a rotation model 
• $H \ II$ regions ($H\alpha$) and CO are used

The observed rotational velocity of the Galactic disc is approximately constant with radius $$v \approx \text{constant} \approx 220  \ \text{km \ }s^{-1} $$This requires differential rotation: stars closer to the centre of the galaxy orbit in a shorter time (period $T^2\propto r^3$) and overtake us, whilst we overtake stars further out

If the spiral arms were a fixed pattern in the stars and gas the differential rotation would cause them to ‘wind-up’ in a few revolutions

Spiral arms thought to be a density wave pattern that rotates at a slower speed than the galaxy. Stars and gas pass in and out of the arm. Gas gets compressed in the arms resulting in star formation
