Stars are plotted on a graph of luminosity versus effective temperature, which reveals a very distinctive pattern. 

Most stars lie on the main sequence, whilst red giants lie above the main sequence, supergiant's lay across the top and white dwarfs lie below the main sequence

Larger stars (if also of similar mass) will have a lower average density which means less collisions between atoms.

**Mas luminosity relation**
Stellar masses determined from binary stars reveal a relationship between mass and luminosity for main sequence of the form
$$L\propto M^{3.3}$$
The lifetime of a main sequence star is given by
$$\tau_{ms}=\frac{E}{L}$$
$$\Delta mc^2\propto M$$
$$\therefore \tau_{ms}\propto \frac{M}{L}\propto \frac{M}{M^{3.3}}\propto M^{-2.3}$$
The lower limit for mass of stars on the main sequence is approximately $0.08M_{\odot}$ and an upper limit is again approximately $100M_{\odot}$


The initial mass of a star determines its fate and we can divide them into 2 broad categories:
- Low mass stars like the sun
- High mass stars that are 10-100 times more massive than the Sun

Low mass stars evolve in red giants as the core does not have enough hydrogen to burn  shrinking the core and expanding the envelope.  After all helium is burned, the envelope is ejected as planetary nebule and leaves behind a white dwarf

High mass stars evolve into super giants, which have so much mass they burn elements successively until iron, and then successively explode as supernovae. As the core collapses in on itself a neutron star or a black hole is left behind.
