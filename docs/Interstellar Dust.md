The presence of interstellar dust is inferred from the dark extinction lanes seen in our galaxy and other galaxies. Background starlight or nebula light is blocked out. The dust is made of small grains of $\approx 5 -500  \ \text{nm}$  mixed with interstellar gas.

The dust along the line of sight causes objects to appear dimmer. This amount of dimming is measured in magnitudes and is called total .

In the $V$ band this is called $A_{v}$
$$A_{v}=(m_{v})_{observed} \ - \ (m_{v})_{intrinsic}$$

In terms of absolute magnitude
$$m_{v}-M_{v}=5\log d-5+A_{v}$$
The amount of extinction varies with wavelength and extinction is larger at blue wavelengths than red wavelengths, $A_{B}>A_{V}$. Therefore interstellar dust causes background objects to appear redder as well as dimmer

The amount of reddening is also measured in magnitudes and is the difference between the observed and intrinsic colour and this is called the colour excess
$$E(B-V)=(B-V)_{observed}-(B-V)_{intrinsic}$$
How the extinction varies with wavelength is called the extinction law . The slope of the law allows the visual extinction to be related to the colour excess
$$A_{v}\approx_{3}E(B-V)$$
If the intrinsic colour of a source is known, then the extinction can be measured

The extinction drops as the wavelength increases. Therefore observations at near-infrared wavelengths are good for seeing through dust obscuration. Near-infrared wavelengths are $1-3 \ \mu \text{m}$ (J,H & K filters)


Dust grains in interstellar space are usually at a temperature of about $30 \ \text{K}$. Hence, they emit at around $100 \ \mu \text{m}$ which is at far-infrared wavelengths. If dust grains are near a hot star then they can get heated up to around $300 \ \text{K}$. Then they emit at mid-infrared wavelengths $\approx 10 \ \mu \text{m}$.


Consider a grain with radius, $a$, at distance, $d$, from a star of luminosity, $L$

Equate fraction of starâ€™s luminosity absorbed by grain with blackbody emission from the grain
$$\frac{\pi a^2}{4\pi d^2}L\approx 4\pi a^2\sigma T^4$$
$$T\approx\left( \frac{L}{16\pi \sigma d^2} \right)^{\frac{1}{4}}$$
When stars form the dust in the molecular clouds gets heated up by the new stars. Hence, star forming regions are bright infrared sources, in particular where massive, hot stars are being born.
