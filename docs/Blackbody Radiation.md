A perfect absorber and emitter of radiation is called a blackbody. Intensity of radiation is described by the Planck function
$$B_{\lambda}=\frac{2hc^2}{\lambda^2}\frac{1}{e^{\frac{hc}{kT\lambda}}-1}$$
Wien Displacement Law says the wavelength of the peak of emission from a blackbody of temperature $T$ is given by
$$\lambda_{max}=\frac{3\times10^{-3}}{T}$$
The total power in the radiation for, a sphere if radius R emitting blackbody radiation with temperature T is
$$L=4\pi R^2\sigma T^4$$

This is used to defined the effective temperature, $T_{eff}$ of a star 

We can also determine the luminosity of a star by finding the total flux of radiation reaching earth as long as we also know the distance. When we observe the spectrum of a star we are measuring the flux of radiation as a function of wavelength

Monochromatic flux of radiation $f_{\lambda}$ is defined as the amount of energy crossing a unit area per unit time per unit wavelength 
The flux of radiation $f$ is defined as the amount of energy crossing a unit area per unit wavelength 

At a distance, $d$, from a star is given by 
$$f=\frac{L}{4\pi d^2}$$
