Visal binaries are spatially resolved in the sky in orbut around each other. Spectroscopic binaries are not spatially resolved by they have orbital motion which is detected through periodic shifts in the spectral lines due to the doppler effect.

We can measure the period $P$ and use [[Kepler's 3rd Law|Kepler's law]] to determine $M_{1}+M_{2}$
If we measure the angular semi major axes then 
$$\frac{\theta_{1}}{\theta_{2}}=\frac{r_{1}}{r_{2}}=\frac{M_{2}}{M_{1}}$$
Doppler shifts of spectral lines given an object is moving at non relativistic speeds follow the formula
$$\frac{v_{r}}{c}=\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda_{0}}$$
For circular orbits velocities are given by
$$v_{1}=\frac{2\pi r_{1}}{P}$$
$$v_{2}=\frac{2\pi r_{2}}{P}$$
For an inclination angle $i$, the observed radial velocities are 
$$v_{r1}=v_{1}\sin i$$
$$v_{r2}=v_{2}\sin i$$
We can determine the mass ratio from 
$$\frac{v_{r{1}}}{v_{r_{r2}}}=$$[[Binary Systems PPT.pdf]]
