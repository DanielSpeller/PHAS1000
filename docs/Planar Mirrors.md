Light from the point source $P$ is reflected by a mirror. After reflection, the rays diverge, and it appears as if they came from $P’$ i.e. image appears behind the mirror.  $P$’$ is the image of object $P$ and is visible from anywhere in the orange shaded region. It is a virtual image (it appears to come from behind the mirror – and cannot be captured directly e.g., on a piece of card or film)

Two mirrors, at an angle to each other, form multiple images. Rays reflected from mirrors $1$ and $2$ create image $P_{12}’’$.  Note that $P_{12}’’$ is an image of $P_1’$ in mirror $2$. i.e. The image $P_1’$ can be treated as if it were an object.

-  $AV$ = principal axis  
-  $V$ = “Vertex” (middle of mirror)  
-  $C$ = centre of curvature = centre of mirror  
-  Radius of curvature = the distance $CV$

The **paraxial rays** (those nearly parallel to the principal axis) are focused by a spherical mirror.

**Non-paraxial rays** are not focused and blur the image (“spherical aberration”). In the following  
treatments we only consider paraxial rays.#

Consider two light rays from object, PQ  
1. A ray through centre of curvature. It is incident normal to the mirror, and so  
is reflected back on itself.  
2. A ray that strikes mirror at “vertex” V (on principal axis).  
Image occurs at the point, P’, at which these rays intersect.

$QPV$ and $Q’P’V$ are similar triangles
$$\frac{h}{s}=-\frac{h'}{s'}\rightarrow-\frac{h'}{h}=\frac{s'}{s}=\frac{(r-s')}{(s-r)}$$

$$\text{lateral magnification}\equiv\frac{\text{image height}}{\text{object height}}\equiv\frac{h'}{h}=-\frac{s'}{s}<0$$
$$\frac{r-s'}{s-r}=\frac{s'}{s}\Rightarrow sr-ss'=ss'-rs'$$
$$\frac{1}{s}+\frac{1}{s'}=\frac{2}{r}$$
If the object is a long way from the mirror, $s ≫ r$,  then rays from object can be considered to parallel, and $\frac{1}{s} \rightarrow 0$ so $s’ \rightarrow r/2$
Parallel rays are brought to a focus half-way between the mirror and the  centre of curvature, at the **focal point** ($F$)

Distance of $F$ from the mirror is the **focal length** $f = \frac{r}{2}$
$$\frac{1}{s}+\frac{1}{s'}=\frac{1}{f}$$
Image is conveniently found using principal rays:  
1. parallel ray, parallel to axis, is reflected through focal point.  
2. focal ray, through focal point, is reflected parallel to axis.  
3. radial ray, through centre of curvature, is reflected back on itself.  
Image occurs at the intersection of the principal rays

When the object s between the focal point and the mirror $(s<f)$, then $\frac{1}{s}> \frac{1}{f}$, hence
$$\frac{1}{s'}=\frac{1}{f}-\frac{1}{s}<0$$

Reflection of plane waves (parallel rays) from a convex spherical mirror, diverging rays (curved wave-fronts) appear to originate from F.

Centre of curvature is now behind the mirror, so distance $r=CV$ is negative and $f<0$
