Molar heat capacity $(c')$  is the heat needed to raise the temperature of one mole by one Kelvin.
$$Q=nc'\Delta T$$
$$C=mc=nc'$$
$$c'=Mc$$
$c'_{v}$ is the molar heat capacity for a substance heated at a constant volume.

Monatomic molecules only have translational kinetic energy, compared to diatomic molecules which has translational and rotational.
Each way in which a system can absorb energy is called a degree of freedom
Translation:
$$\frac{1}{2}mv_{av}^2=\frac{1}{2}mv_{x}^2+\frac{1}{2}mv_{y}^2+\frac{1}{2}mv_{z}^2$$
Rotational: (Rotation around bond axis is negligible )
$$\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2=\frac{1}{2}I_{x}\omega_{x}^2+\frac{1}{2}I_{y}\omega_{y}^2+\frac{1}{2}I_{z}\omega_{z}^2$$
Vibration:
$$E_{vib}=E_{k}=E_{p}$$
$$E_{vib}=\frac{1}{2}\mu v^2+\frac{1}{2}kx^2$$
When a substance is in thermal equilibrium there is an average energy of $\frac{1}{2}kT$ associated with each degree of freedom.
$$\frac{1}{2}mv_{av}^2=3\left( \frac{1}{2}kT \right)=\frac{3}{2}kT$$
$$Q=nc'\Delta T$$
$$dQ=nc'dT$$
$$c'=\frac{1}{n} \frac{dQ}{dT}$$
$$c'_{v}=\frac{1}{n} \frac{dU}{dT}$$
Each atom in a crystalline in a solid can vibrate about its equilibrium position. The Dulong-Petit law states
$$c'_{v}=3R$$
This is only valid at high temperatures when are degrees of freedom are active.
