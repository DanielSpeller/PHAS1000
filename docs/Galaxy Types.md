A galaxy is a gravitationally bound collection of stars, gas and dust. They are usually isolated in space but can interact with near neighbours and are the main visible component of the universe,

Galaxies are seen in 3 major types:
- Spiral
	 - Rotating disc dominated by spiral arms which are rich in hot, blue young stars and gas and dust. This is where the formation of new stars takes place.
	 - An elliptical concentration of stars at the centre is called the bulge, which is rich in red stars of Population II and old Population I
	 - Spiral galaxies also appear in barred form where the two arms originate from the ends of a central linear feature of bulge-like stars
- Elliptical
	 - Elliptical collections of red stars of  Population II and old Population
	 - Smooth variation of intensity
	 - Very little gas and dust
	 - Little organised rotation
- Irregular
	- No regular structure
	- Contains plenty of gas, dust and blue stars 
	- Mixture of Population I and II
	- Usually relatively small
