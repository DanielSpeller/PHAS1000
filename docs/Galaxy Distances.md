Standard candles are well known objects that are bright and well calibrated. If we know $M_v$ and $A_v$ we can determine its distance and apparent brightness
$$m_{v}-M_{v}=5\log d-5+A_{v}$$
We can estimate $M_v$ from the spectral type of normal stars but it is often not very accurate

Cepheid variables are variable stars that have a periodic change in their brightness due to their evolution being  unstable and pulsating regularly. They show a clear correlation between the period of pulsation and the luminosity of a star, and this relationship changes with the metallicity.

The collapse of a white dwarf at its mass limit is a very controlled explosion with a well defied maximum brightness. This is extremely large and so can be seen at large distances
