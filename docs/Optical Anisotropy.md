 In an electromagnetic field, impinging on a material will cause the ionic lattice to oscillate with the same frequency. The result is the formation of a dipole moment that oscillates and radiates electromagnetic waves of the same frequency.

Light travels in the forward direction  where light from different dipoles constructively interferes. The refractive index of a material tells us about its ability to respond to the electric field.

In **isotropic** media, the refractive indices are the same in all directions
$$n_{x}=n_{y}=n_{z}=n$$
Light entering the medium from any direction or polarisation state will behave the same due to the refractive index

In **anisotropic** media, the refractive indices are different is some or all directions
$$n_{x}\neq n_{y}\neq n_{z}$$
Light entering the medium from different direction or polarisation state will behave differently due to the refractive index

The induced polarization $\underline{P}$ is the dipole moment per unit volume is proportional to the size of the applied field $\underline{E}$ 
$$\underline{P}=\varepsilon_{0}\chi \underline{E}$$
If the material is isotropic the $\chi$ is the same in all directions, whereas **anisotropic** materials will have different $\chi$ values.

If the $\underline{E}$ field as components in each direction then we have to include the polarization terms due to the other fields
