The E-field is much stronger than the B-field (by a factor of c – the speed of light)  
$$E_{y}=cB_{z}$$

The polarization state of light is described by the plane that the electric field vector oscillates in. Light which has light oscillates only in one plane is known as plane or linearly polarized light. A typical, linear, polarizer only allows light whose electric field oscillates in the direction of the transmission axis through to create a linearly polarized beam.
$$\vec{E}_{x}(z,t)=\hat{i}(E_{0})_{x}\cos(kz-\omega t)$$
$$\vec{E}_{}(z,t)=\hat{j}(E_{0})_{y}\cos(kz-\omega t+\varepsilon)$$
For waves in phase $\varepsilon =0$
$$\vec{E}=(\hat{i}(E_{0})_{x}+\hat{j}(E_{0})_{y})\cos(kz-\omega t)$$
For waves out of phase $\varepsilon\neq0$
$$\vec{E}=E_{0}(\hat{i}\cos(kz-\omega t)+\hat{j}\sin(kz-\omega t))$$
There exists an angle at which light polarized parallel to the surface (s-polarized) is reflected,  
whilst light polarized in the plane of incidence (p-polarized) is transmitted  

This angles is known as the Brewster Angle
$$\tan \theta_{p}=\tan\left( \frac{n_{1}}{n_{0}} \right)$$
The phase difference may arise from a difference in path length traversed by the two waves, as  
well as a difference in the initial phase angle vv
$$E_{1}=A\cos(\omega t-kx_{1}+\phi_{1}) \  \& \ E_{2}=A\cos(\omega t-kx_{2}+\phi_{2})$$
Then phase difference
$$\Phi=(kx_{1}+\phi_{1})-(kx_{2}+\phi_{2})=(kx_{1}-kx_{2})+(\phi_{1}-\phi_{2})$$
If the difference in the initial phase angle=0 then the phase difference arises from the difference  
in path length
$$\Phi=k(x_{1}-x_{2})=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}(x_{1}-x_{2})$$
For light travelling in a medium of refractive index $n$,$\lambda=\frac{\lambda_{0}}{n}$

Light is said to be coherent if there is a constant phase difference between different waves and such waves will undergo interference dependent on their phase difference.  

Lasers are the best source of coherent light – as they produce near-perfect monochromatic light - and hence nearly infinite coherence length.  

The Coherence length is the length of the individual wave packets and provides a measure  of the coherence in a beam. For a typical light source, this may only be of millimetres in length, whereas for lasers, it can be many kilometres.
