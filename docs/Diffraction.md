If L is large the rays are close to parallel and form *Fraunhofer diffraction* patters
If L is small a *Fresnel diffraction* pattern is produced, as the rays cannot be considered parallel 

Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of a circular aperture s of particular significance due to their many applications and for the first minima
$$\sin \theta=\frac{1.22\lambda}{D}\approx \theta$$
Consider light from two stars that are of equal brightness imaged by a telescope with circular aperture of diameter D. Each star will produce a Fraunhofer diffraction limited pattern not a point image. The images can be resolved when the centre of one airy disk falls on the the first minimum of the other otherwise know as Rayleigh's criterion.
