Friction is the force that resists motion between two sliding surfaces. It always acts in the direction opposite of motion (i.e. the opposite direction of the velocity vector)

Static friction opposes motion before it starts, up to a limit:
$$|\vec  F_f|\leq \mu_s|\vec R| \iff |\vec v|=0$$
Kinetic friction opposes motion after it starts, and remains constant
$$|\vec F_f|=\mu_k|\vec R|\iff|\vec v| \neq 0$$
