All irreversible processes move a system towards a less ordered state. Entropy is a thermodynamic function: $𝑆$
It is the change in entropy that is important.
$$dS=\frac{dQ_{rev}}{T}$$
Entropy change in a cycle is zero for a reversible cycle, and $< 0$ for an irreversible cycle.
$$\Delta S_{cycle}=\oint \frac{dQ}{T}\leq_{0}$$
$$\Delta S_{universe}=\Delta S_{process}+\Delta S_{surrounding}\geq0$$

Every irreversible process, we move towards increased entropy in the universe. At some point, all useful energy will have been  
converted into wasted energy, and thus the universe will “die”, that is, nothing irreversible will ever happen again.

Entropy is a state function, so only the start and the end states of the system matter to calculate the change in entropy: we can use any reversible process between them to calculate the change in entropy

For an ideal gas
$$\Delta S=\int^2_{1} \frac{dQ_{rev}}{T}$$
$$dU=dQ_{rev}+dW_{on}$$
$$dW_{on}=-PdV$$
$$du=C_{v}dT$$
$$dQ_{rev}=C_{v}dT+PdV$$
$$dQ_{rev}=C_{v}dT+nRT \frac{dV}{V}$$
$$\Delta S=\int^{T_{2}}_{T_{1}} \frac{C_{v}dT}{T}+\int^{V_{2}}_{V_{1}} nR \frac{dV}{V}$$
$$\Delta S=C_{v}\ln  \left(\frac{T_{1}}{T_{2}} \right)+nR\ln \left(\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}}\right)$$
$$\Delta S_{isothe\mathrm{al}}=nR\ln \left(\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}}\right)$$
$$Q_{rev}=nRT\ln \left(\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}}\right)$$
