#Thermal #Y1 #PHAS1000 
Temperature is a measure of the average translational kinetic energy of atoms or molecules The SI unit of temperature is defined as Kelvin ($K$).

If,
$$T\propto E_{k}$$
$$\frac{3}{2}kT=E_{k}=\frac{mv^2}{2}$$
As the temperature reduces, an atoms speed decreases, therefore increasing its wavelength
$$\lambda=\frac{h}{mv}$$
