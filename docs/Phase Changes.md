Van der Waals equation of state:
$$(P+\frac{an^2}{V^2})(V-bn)=nRT$$
where b is the actual volume of one mole of gas molecules, this is because gas molecules have finite size, so free volume available to each molecule is reduced. ^572303

As a molecule approaches the wall it is pulled back by surrounding molecule with a force proportional to density $\frac{n}{v}$. But frequency of molecules hitting the wall is also proportional to density thus attractive for is $\left( \frac{n}{v} \right)^2$
