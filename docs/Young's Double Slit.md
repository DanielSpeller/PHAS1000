#Optics #PHAS1000 #Y1 
If you illuminate two very narrow slits, a distance, $d$, apart by a small, distant source. Each slit behaves as a source of coherent light*. Interference of light was observed by Thomas Young in 1801.  Phase difference at different points on screen depends on path difference  
Constructive interference (bright fringes) occurs when the signals arrive in-phase, when the path difference equals an integer number of wavelengths,  
$$\Delta=m\lambda$$
or when the phase difference
$$\Phi=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}d\sin \theta=2\pi m$$
Constructive interference (bright fringes) occurs when the signals arrive in-phase, when the path difference equals an integer number of wavelengths, or when the phase difference
$$\Delta=d\sin \theta=\left( m+\frac{1}{2} \right)\lambda$$
$m$ is called the order and takes values#
$$m\in\mathbb Z$$
“Zeroth order maximum” is the central fringe (and occurs at $\theta=0$, $m=0$). The interference pattern can be used to measure the wavelength of light.

We can relate the distance $y_m$ measured along the screen from the central point to the $m^{th}$ bright fringe.  For small angles, $\tan \theta \approx \sin \theta$. Substituting $\frac{y_{m}}{L}$ for  
$\sin \theta _m$ , and solving for $y_{m}$ we get
$$m\lambda=d\sin \theta\Rightarrow m\lambda=d \frac{y}{L}$$
$$y_{m}=m \frac{\lambda L}{d}$$
$$y_{m+1}=(m+1) \frac{\lambda L}{d}$$
$$\Delta y= \frac{\lambda L}{d}$$
Electric field at 

Point P is a superposition of the fields due to the two sources $S_1$ & $S_2$ 
$$E_{total}=E_1+E_{2}$$
$$E_{1}=E_{0}\cos(\omega t-kx)$$
$$E_{2}=E_{0}\cos(\omega t-kx+\phi)$$
$$E_{total}=E_{0}(\cos(\omega t-kx)+\cos(\omega t-kx+\phi))$$
$$E_{total}=2E_{0}\cos\left( \frac{\phi}{2} \right)\cos\left( \omega t-kx+\frac{\phi}{2} \right)$$So, $E_{total}$ has same frequency and wavenumber as each source,  
but the amplitude varies $2E_{0}\cos\left( \frac{\phi}{2} \right)$

$$\text{Intensity}\propto \text{Field amplitude}^2$$
$$I\propto \left( 2E_{0}\cos\left( \frac{\phi}{2} \right) \right)^2$$
$$\Rightarrow I=4E_{0}^2\cos^2\left( \frac{\phi}{2} \right)=4I_{0}\cos^2\left( \frac{\phi}{2} \right)$$
$$\phi=\frac{2\pi d\sin \theta}{\lambda}$$
Interference does not create or destroy energy; it just redistributes it. Intensity of each fringe is $=4I_{0}$ the .  Average Intensity $= 2I_{0}$

Maximum number of fringes is finite - the maximum number of fringes is found when the path difference is equal to, d, the distance between the two slits.
$$\Delta=d\sin \theta=m\lambda$$
