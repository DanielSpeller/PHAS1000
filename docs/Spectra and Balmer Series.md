Absorption lines arise when we view a hot source of continuum radiation through a cooler layer of gas. Because the temperature drops with height in the atmosphere of stars we view cooler gas against a hotter background.

Spectra of stars consist of a vast number of absorption lines from different species. One of the most recognizable is the Balmer series due to atomic hydrogen. This series arises from transitions from the n=2 level in H

Strength of an absorption line depends on:
- Strength of the particular transition (absorption cross-section), i.e. depends on atomic physics
- Number of particles in the lower state of the transition, i.e. depends on abundance, temperature and density
