1. **Executive Summary (Page 9):**
    
    - Public transport is crucial for decarbonisation and equity.
    - Funding needs to exceed USD 2 trillion per year to 2050, with a focus on emerging economies.
    - Effective strategies involve efficiency, competition, and diversified funding (fares, taxes, land value capture).
    - Fare policies need reform to ensure efficiency and fairness.
    - Land-value capture and earmarked taxes can provide additional funding.
    - Efficiency gains can reduce funding needs; benchmarking and structured fare policies are key.
    - Private finance may be necessary, but it requires careful structuring to ensure value for public investment.
2. **Effective Strategies to Achieve Sustainability Goals (Page 16):**
    
    - Public transport investment must increase to support a shift from private car use.
    - Examples from France, Germany, and Sweden show that strategic investment and clear targets can drive significant change.
    - Efficiency in spending and service provision is essential to maximise the impact of funds.
3. **Sustainable Mobility and Public Transport Interconnection (Page 18):**
    
    - Sustainable urban mobility plans (SUMPs) aim to reduce reliance on private cars through better public transport and urban design.
    - Equity and accessibility are core concerns, ensuring transport options for all, especially those without cars.
    - Integration of transport modes and smart urban planning can reduce emissions and improve quality of life.
4. **Coordination Between Institutions (Page 22):**
    
    - Effective public transport requires coordination among regional, local, and national bodies.
    - Metropolitan transport authorities (MTAs) and cross-regional cooperation can improve service integration and efficiency.
    - Case studies from France and Canada highlight the benefits of coordinated planning and service delivery.
5. **Effective Competition to Increase Efficiency (Page 23):**
    
    - Moving from public monopolies to competitive tendering can reduce costs and improve service quality.
    - Properly designed competitive processes ensure that efficiency gains do not compromise service quality.
    - The report cites Barcelonaâ€™s success in reducing subsidies through competitive contracting.
6. **What is Land-Value Capture? (Page 43):**
    
    - Land-value capture (LVC) involves funding public transport by taxing the increased property values that result from improved accessibility.
    - Mechanisms include property taxes, developer contributions, and integrated development models.
    - Effective LVC requires transparent processes and consideration of equity impacts.
7. **Implementing Land-Value Capture: Equity Challenges (Page 54):**
    
    - LVC must balance revenue generation with social equity, ensuring that it does not disproportionately burden lower-income residents.
    - Case studies highlight the need for fair implementation to maintain public trust and support.
8. **Other Revenue Sources (Page 67):**
    
    - Advertising, sponsorship, and commercial partnerships provide supplementary income but are typically small relative to overall funding needs.
    - Innovative financing models can be explored but should not obscure long-term cost and revenue realities.
