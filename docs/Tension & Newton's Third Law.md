When an extended object is stretched, there is an internal force that resists further stretching. This is the tension in the object. A key point about tension is that its value is the same throughout the extended object, as long as there are no additional forces acting on intermediate points of the object. 

When an object is stretched, its subsequent behaviour depends on the properties of the material of which the object is made. Elastically deformed objects obey Hooke‚Äôs Law: The restoring force (tension) in an elastically extended object is proportional to the extension

Let‚Äôs consider a particle connected to the end of an elastic string. The particle will naturally rest at some equilibrium position. When the particle is displaced from this equilibrium by an amount $‚àÜùë•$, there is a restoring force or tension $F$  in the string, given by,
$$F= -k\Delta x$$
Since the the tension is a function of extension, $F=F(\Delta x)$, a Taylor expansion of this function gives 
$$F\approx k_{0}+k_{1}\Delta x+k_{2}(\Delta x)^2+\dots$$
By considering only elastic deformation, we are restricting ourselves to small ‚àÜùë•, in which case higher-order terms become negligible, and
$$F\approx k_{0}+k_{1}\Delta x$$
At every point along a rope (or any continuous object with no extension), [[Newton's Laws of Motion|Newton‚Äôs second & third laws]] imply that the forces must be equal. If the forces were not in equilibrium at any point, extension would occur at that point
