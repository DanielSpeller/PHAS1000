Parallax is the apparent change in the position of an object due to a change in viewpoint. Nearby stars also appear to move relative to more distant background stars due to the motion of the Earth around the Sun.

The trigonometric parallax angle, $p$, of a star is half the angle through which a star appears to move relative to background stars due to the earth motion around the sun in 6 months.

The unit of distance used in astrophysics is the parsec or parallax arcsecond. It is defined as the distance of a star has a trigonometric parallax angle of one arcsecond.

$$d=\left( \frac{1 \ AU}{\sin p} \right)=\frac{1.5\times 10^{12}}{\sin 0.00277778}=3.09\times 10^{16}$$
$$d(pc)=\frac{1}{p('')}$$
Stars also move across the sky due to their true motion - this is proper motion, $\mu$,and is measured in arcseconds per year
