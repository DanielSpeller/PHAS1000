For a fixed mass if gas at constant temperature
$$PV=k$$

For an ideal gas
 $$PV=nRT$$$$PV=NkT$$
$$R=kN_{a}$$
Assumptions for kinetic theory
- Gas contains many molecules
- Molecules are well separated
- Direction of motion of molecules is random 
- Molecules exert no force on each other except upon collision
- Elastic collisions between molecules and with walls

Consider a rectangular box of volume V containing N gas molecules each off mass m moving with speed v

Molecules that will hit right hand wall of area A int time interval$\Delta t$ are those within $v_{x}\Delta t$ of the wall and moving to the right along x axis
Number of molecules is 
$$\frac{1}{2}\frac{N}{V}v_{x}\Delta tA$$
Change of momentum per molecule upon a collision is
$$2mv_{x}$$
$$P=\frac{F}{A}$$
$$F=\frac{|\Delta \bar p|}{\Delta t}$$
$$|\Delta \bar p|=(2mv_{x})\times\left(\frac{1}{2}\frac{n}{V}v_{x}\Delta tA\right)=\frac{N}{V}mv_{x}^2A\Delta t$$
$$E_{k}=\frac{3}{2}kT$$
