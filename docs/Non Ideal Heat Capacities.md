So far, we have worked with heat capacities $C_{V}$ and $C_{P}$. These are defined as
$$C_{V}=\left( \frac{\delta Q}{\delta T} \right)_{V}$$
$$C_{P}=\left( \frac{\delta Q}{\delta T} \right)_{P}$$
The heat capacity ratio or adiabatic index or ratio of specific heats
$$\gamma=\frac{C_{P}}{C_{V}}$$It is sometimes known as the isentropic expansion factor

For all substances that expand when heating, $C_{P}>C_{V}$, as the expansion of the substance makes work. This is usually negligible for solids and liquid, but not for gases.
$$C_{P}=C_{V}+nR$$
$$dU=\delta Q+dW$$
$$dU=C_{p}dT-PdV$$
For an ideal gas
$$PV=nRT$$
$$pdV+VdP=nRdT$$
For constant V
$$PdV=nRdT$$
$$C_{p}dT=dU+PdV$$
$$C_{p}dT=(C_{V}+nR)dT$$
[[Equipartition]]

If the spacing of the allowed energy levels is large compared to $k_{B}T$, energy cannot be transferred by collisions and the classical equipartition theorem is not valid.

If the spacing of the levels is much smaller than $k_{B}T$, energy quantization will not be noticed and the equipartition theorem will hold

The angular momentum is quantized
$$U_{rot}=l(l+1)U_{or}=l(l+1) \frac{\hbar^2}{2I} \ \forall \ l \in\mathbb N$$
At low temperatures, the gases may not have enough energy to reach the quantized amount $(k_{B}T\ll U_{rot})$ and we will have quantum effects. 

At high enough temperatures, they quantum steps will be small compared to the energy of the molecules and we will have a classical behaviour $(T>T_{c})$

Heat capacities of solids and liquids are generally higher than gases due to intermolecular forces $C_{P}>C_{V}$ 

For solids, Dulong-Petit law estates that $C_{V}=3R$
- Is only relevant to metallic, heavier elements
- Only applicable to elements in solid form

Heat Capacities
$$C_{V}-C_{P}=T\left( \frac{\partial S}{\partial T} \right)_{V}-T\left( \frac{\partial S}{\partial V} \right)_{P}$$
$$dS=\left( \frac{\partial S}{\partial T} \right)_{V}dT+\left( \frac{\partial S}{\partial V} \right)_{T}dV$$
$$\left( \frac{\partial S}{\partial T} \right)_{P}=\left( \frac{\partial S}{\partial T} \right)_{V}\left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial T} \right)_{P}+\left( \frac{\partial S}{\partial V} \right)_{T}\left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial T} \right)_{P}=\frac{C_{V}}{T}+\left( \frac{\partial S}{\partial V} \right)_{T}\beta V$$
$$C_{P}=T\left( \frac{\partial S}{\partial T} \right)_{P}=C_{V}+T\beta V\left( \frac{\partial S}{\partial V} \right)_{T}=C_{V}+T\beta V\left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial T} \right)_{V}$$
$$\left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial P} \right)_{T}\left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial T} \right)_{V}\left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial V} \right)_{P}=-1$$
$$\left( \frac{\partial P}{\partial T} \right)_{V}=-\frac{1}{\left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial P} \right)_{T}\left( \frac{\partial T}{\partial V} \right)_{P}}=\frac{\left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial T} \right)_{P}}{\left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial P} \right)_{T}}=\frac{\beta V}{V\kappa_{T}}=\frac{\beta}{\kappa _{T}}$$
$$C_{P}-C_{V}=\frac{TV\beta^2}{\kappa_{T}}$$
