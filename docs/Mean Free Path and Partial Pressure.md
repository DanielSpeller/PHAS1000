The average distance travelled by a molecule between collisions is denoted by $\lambda$ and is called the mean free path

Consider one gas molecule with radius $r_{1}$ moving with speed $v$ through a region of stationary molecules. It will collide with another molecules of radius $r_2$ id the centres come within $d=r_1+r_2$. If all molecules are the same type $d=$ molecular diameter. In some time $t$ molecules will move distance $vt$ and collides with every molecule which has its centre in cylindrical volume $\pi d^2vt$. The number of molecules un thus volume us $n_{v}\pi d^2vt$where $n_{v}=\frac{N}{V}$.

$$\lambda=\frac{vt}{n_{v}\pi d^2vt}$$
$$\lambda=\frac{1}{n_{v}\pi d^2}$$
However if all the molecules are moving then we need to consider their average relative velocity
$$\overline{v_{relative}^2}=\overline{(v_{1}-v_{2})^2}=\overline{v_{1}^2+v_{2}^2-2(v_{1}\cdot v_{2})}$$
For random motion $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ are uncorrelated
$$\lambda=\frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2}n_{V}\pi d^2}$$
If we define collision time as $\tau$
$$\lambda=v_{rms}\tau$$
<h3>Mixed gases</h3>Both sets of gas molecules occupy the whole volume of the container
$$P_{total}=\sum_{i=1}^nP_{i}$$
$$P_{i}=\frac{n_{i}RT}{V}$$
$$P_{i}=\left( \frac{n_{i}}{n_{t}} \right)P_{t}$$
