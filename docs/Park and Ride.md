Park and rides aim to reduce congestion in the city by intercepting cars coming in from the edge of the city by adding additional parking. It is hoped this will boast the local economy and reduce air pollution due to the efficiency of buses. There is an assumption that a car may be owned which could disadvantage those from a lower economic background however some people in this category may be from rural areas and therefore dependent on this scheme.

There are three main effects from park and rides
- Detouring - Park and ride is not on the original route of the commuter and therefore detouring them to the car park
- Abstraction -
- New trips -

These effects are clearly override the benefits and generally the environment is more impacted due to increased carbon emissions.

Link and ride is an idea with smaller car parks along bus routes that are already operating meaning people are able to intercept earlier leading to less detouring. This is already coming into place in Cambridge.
