#Solid_State #PHAS1000 #Y1 
Criteria for a solid:  
- Can sustain a shear stress without yielding  
- The building blocks such as atoms or molecules have well defined average positions (atoms or molecules however undergo vibrations centered on these sites)

General form of the bond potential energy  
-  The potential energy should approach zero for large inter-particle distances, $r$.  
-  For small inter-particle distances, the potential energy should be large and positive since two atoms/ molecules can not be superimposed (due to the Pauli exclusion principle).  
- For a bond to form between two atoms/molecules there must be a minimum (negative value) in the potential energy at some characteristic separation corresponding to the equilibrium bond length, $r_0$. The depth of the minimum below zero corresponds to the bond energy (or bond strength), $U_0$

Taking a [[Taylor Series]] around $r_0$ 
$$U(r)=U(r_{0})+\frac{dU(r_{0})}{dr}(r-r_{0})+\frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2U(r_{0})}{dr^2}(r-r_{0})^2+\dots$$
$$U(r)\approx U(r_{0})+\frac{1}{2}k(r-r_{0})^2, k=\frac{d^2U(r_{0})}{dr^2}$$
and so the bond can be modelled as a spring at points close to the equilibrium bond distance
