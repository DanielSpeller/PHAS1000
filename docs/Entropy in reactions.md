As we know, a heat transfer from a hot to a cold body is irreversible (the heat will not transfer spontaneously from a cold to a hot body). In this case, the entropy is calculated by looking at the heat for each independent reservoir as if it was transferred reversibly.

So far, we have considered changes in internal energy of a system as heating.
$$\Delta U=C_{V}\Delta T$$

What if we have a system that is exchanging heat but keeping a constant temperature? (without being in touch with a temperature reservoir)  

What about an isolated system that is getting hotter or colder without exchanging heat/work with its surroundings? This can happen if the heat is invested in a change of entropy of the molecules, through a phase change or a chemical change.  

In chemical reactions, we can calculate the change of entropy by using standard  
molar entropies, listed for a reference temperature and pressure.
$$\Delta S=\sum_{n}n\cdot S_{products}-\sum_{m}m\cdot S_{reactants}$$
Intuitively, what may be happening is that there is more order in one side than in the other of the chemical reaction.

Lets consider $N$ particles in our thermodynamic system, each with energy levels $𝜖_{i}$. The whole system energy would be:  
$$U=\sum N_{i}\epsilon_{i}$$  
Where $𝑁_𝑖$ is the number of particles with energy $\epsilon_i$.

The multiplicity $W$ is defined as 
$$W_{i}=\frac{N!}{N_{1}!N_{2}!\dots N_{M}!}$$
Where $N$ is the number of particles and $N_{i}$ is the number of particles on each of the energy levels.

If our particles are indistinguishable and we have many of them, then we end up always measuring the most likely macrostate.
$$S=k_{b}\ln W$$
So entropy is directly related to the number of possible arrangements of a system, that is, in a way it is a measure of disorder.
