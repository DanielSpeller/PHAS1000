Infrastructure is the basic services and facilities needed for national function such as transportation communications, power lines, institutions, education etc. The term is generally defined as a project costing ~ $5,000,000. Historically most infrastructure has been based around the private sector with shareholders hoping to take a profit. Into the 20th century governments have taken more of a role of funding infrastructure as a need for the public was identified. In the modern era public private partnerships are very common with the private sector taking on construction and consultation with most of planning and research left to national and local governments.

The M6 toll is a good case of private investment being one of the few toll roads in the UK. Most vehicles found using this road are HGV's because of the significant business saving a shorter travel time means. The HS1 railway is a good example of a bad relationship between public and private sector as the government is far less able to walk away from projects than private consortiums in fear of a massive hit to their public reputation. Crossrail has proved to be a good success of this type of partnership however, with a Â£15,000,000 investment proving to be successful in this type of alliance.  

Transport infrastructure is seen as one solution to problems, proving to help with issues such as inefficiencies, environment, land use and accessibility. However, negative impacts often include concerns about the environment such as disrupting ecosystems or disrupting drainage. Changes to infrastructure such as expanding capacity of road can often not solve the problem as an increased use of the road leads to the same amount of congestion as before.

The net present value is defined as the excess of the discounted increase in revenues over the discounted increase in costs compared with the do minimum option
$$NPV=\sum_{t=1}^n\frac{(B_{t}-C_{t})}{(1+r)^t }$$
Where:
- $B_{t}=$ Benefit in year $t$
- $C_{t} =$ Cost in year $t$
- $r =$ Opportunity cost of capital 
- $n =$ number of years for which project is evaluated
