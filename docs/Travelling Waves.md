#Waves #PHAS1000 #Y1 
Waves transport energy and momentum without transporting matter

Transverse waves  - Disturbance is perpendicular to direction of propagation
Longitudinal waves - Disturbance is parallel to direction of propagation

At equilibrium, let the string lie along the $x$ axis and make small transverse displacements $y$.

The function $y(x)$ defines the shape of the string at a given instant. The shape will change with time according to some equation of motion

$y$ is also a function and $y(x,t)$ is called the *wavefunction

If a wave pulse has constant shape but moves along with speed $v$, we have a *travelling wave*. At time $t=0$ le the shape be given by 
$$y(x,0)=g(x)$$
At some later time $t$ the pulse is a distance $vt$ further along the string. Therefore we can represent the displacement $y$ for all times by
$$y(x,t)=g(x-vt)$$
$$y(x,t)=g(x+vt)$$
For waves moving left and right respectively

Consider a flexible elastic string to which is attached $N$ identical particles, each of mass $m$, equally spaced a distance $L$ apart, with the ends of the string fixed a distance $L$, mass $1$ and mass $N$ and tension in the string of $T$

The force on the $p^{th}$ mass 
$$F_{p}=-T\sin(\alpha_{p-1})+T \sin(\alpha_{p})$$
 for small $\alpha_{p}$ 
 $$\sin \alpha_{p}\approx \tan \alpha_{p}= \frac{y_{p+1}-y_{p}}{L}$$
 So,
 $$F_{p}=-T(\frac{y_{p}-y_{p-1}}{L})+T\frac{y_{p+1}-y_{p}}{L}$$
 $$\therefore m \frac{d^2y}{dt^2}=-T\left( \frac{y_{p}-y_{p-1}}{L} \right)+T\frac{y_{p+1}-y_{p}}{L}$$
 $$\frac{d^2y_{p}}{dt^2}=\frac{T}{mL}(y_{p+1}-2y_{p}+y_{p-1})$$
