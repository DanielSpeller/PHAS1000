$$Q_{in}=\Delta U+W$$
W is the work done by the system in expand. Gas at pressure P expands quasi-statically and exerts a force F on piston of area A so ,
$$F=PA$$
Work is done by the gas when the piston moves by distance $dx$
$$dW=F_{x}dx=PAdx=PdV$$
$$W=\int ^{V_{f}}_{V_{i}}PdV$$
Therefore if volume constant $W=0$, If pressure constant $W=P\Delta V$

$$Q=nc'\Delta T$$
Molar heat capacity at constant volume $=c'_{v}$
Molar heat capacity at constant pressure $=c'_{p}$

$$c'_{p} >c'_{v}$$
For gases since work is done against the surroundings in expanding when volume is not fixed
$$c'_{p} \approx c'_{v}$$
For liquids and solids as expansion is small


For constant volume
$$\Delta U=Q=nc'_{v}\Delta T$$
For constant pressure
$$\Delta U=Q-W=nc'_{p}\Delta T-P\Delta V$$For the same increase in internal energy
$$nc'\Delta T=Nc'_{p}\Delta T-P\Delta V$$
$$nc'_{v}\Delta T=nc'_{p}\Delta T-nR\Delta T$$
$$c'_{p}-c'_{v}=R$$
