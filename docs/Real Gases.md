For an ideal gas $PV=nRT$, meaning that $\frac{PV}{nRT}=1$

The compressibility factor is a way to measure the deviation from the ideal gas behaviour 
$$Z=\frac{PV}{nRT}$$
We can correct this equation ![[Phase Changes#^572303]]
![[Phase Changes#^d0f969]]

The Thiesen expansion of the ideal gas equation is as follows
$$PV=nRT\left( 1+B(T)\frac{n}{v} +C(T) \left( \frac{n}{v} \right)^2+\dots\right)$$
account for the fact that molecules near a wall of a vessel have higher potential energy than molecules in the bulk

The Dieterici equation accounts for the fact that molecules near a wall of a vessel have higher potential energy than molecules in the bulk
$$PV=nRTe^{\frac{a}{RTV}}$$
The Helmholtz energy equation relates the variation of the internal energy with the volume for a gas at constant temperature
$$dU=TdS-PdV$$
$$dU=\left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial T} \right)_{V}dT=\left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial V} \right)_{T}dV$$
Combining the two equations
$$\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial V}\right)_T=T\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial T}\right)_V-P$$
If $PV=nRT$
$$\left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial V} \right)_{T}=0$$
If $\left( P+ \frac{an^2}{V^2} \right)(V-bn)=nRT$
$$\left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial V} \right)_{T}=\frac{an^2}{V^2}$$The compressibility $\kappa$ is a measure of the relative volume change of a substance in response to a pressure. It may be defined isothermally or isoentropically
$$\kappa_{T}=-\frac{1}{V}\left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial P} \right)_{T}$$
$$\kappa_{S}=-\frac{1}{V}\left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial P} \right)_{S}$$
Coefficient of linear expansion
$$\alpha=\frac{1}{L}\left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial T} \right)_{P}$$
Coefficient of volume expansion
$$\beta=\frac{1}{V}\left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial T} \right)_{P}$$
$$\beta=2\alpha$$
