Supernovae come in two main types
-  Type II when the core of a single massive star collapses at the end of its life to form a neutron star or black hole
- Type Ia when a white dwarf star explodes due to the accretion of matter in a binary star system pushing it over its maximum mass

We can estimate the energy in a supernova explosion from the gravitational potential energy released
$$E_{grav}\approx \frac{GM}{R}$$
The exploding material is initial ejected at several $1000  \ \text{kms}^{-1}$ (mildly relativistic). As the shell expands it sweeps up interstellar material and slows down to a few $100  \ \text{kms}^{-1}$ . They continue to expand for ~ million years before reaching equilibrium and hence can fill a large volume of the galaxy 

The expanding shell is moving much faster than the sound speed in the cool interstellar gas and so a shock wave results . The shocked gas gets heated to a very high temperature. This gas emits in the X-ray region via bremsstrahlung.

Supernovae also emit strongly at radio wavelengths . The combination of fast moving electrons and magnetic fields gives rise to synchrotron radiation. The electrons spiral around the magnetic field 

The synchrotron radiation is strongest at long radio wavelengths ($\approx 1  \ \text{m}$) . Also referred to as non-thermal radio emission to distinguish it from thermal bremsstrahlung. Note the different slopes of the radio spectra for thermal and non-thermal sources.
