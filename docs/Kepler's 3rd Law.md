The mass of a star is difficult to infer from stellar spectra, so instead we use the gravitational influence in a binary star system. Around 60% of stars are in binary or multiple systems

Consider two stars with masses $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ orbiting around the combined centre of mass

$$F_{1}=\frac{M_{1}v_{1}^2}{r_{1}}=\frac{4\pi^2M_{1}r_{1}}{P^2}$$
$$F_{2}=\frac{M_{2}v_{2}^2}{r_{2}}=\frac{4\pi^2M_{2}r_{2}}{P^2}$$
$$M_{1}r_{1}=M_{2}r_{2}$$
$$F_{1}=F_{2}=\frac{GM_{1}M_{2}}{a^2}$$
$$a=r_{1}r_{2}$$
$$\frac{4\pi^2M_{2}r_{2}}{P^2}=\frac{GM_{1}M_{2}}{a^2}$$
$$a=(\frac{M_{1}+M_{2}}{M_{2}})r_{1}$$
$$P^2=\frac{4\pi^2a^3}{G(M_{1}+M_{2})}$$
$$P^2\propto a^3$$
Real orbits are generally elliptical and can be described by the semi-major $a$ and semi-minor $b$ axis

The eccentricity of elliptical orbits is defined by 
$$e=\frac{\sqrt{ a^2-b^2 }}{2}$$
Newtons form of Kepler's third law also applies to elliptical orbits with $a$ the sum of the semi-major axes $a=a_{1}+a_{2}$
