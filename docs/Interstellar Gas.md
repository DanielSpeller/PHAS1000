The space between stars in spiral and irregular galaxies is not empty but contains gas and dust at very low density. A typical average number density is about $10^6  \ m^{-3}$ or 1 particle per cubic centimetre. However, the interstellar gas exists in a vast range of temperatures and densities.

When interstellar gas exists near hot stars it becomes ionized. Hydrogen is ionized by photons with energy $> 13.6 \ eV$or with a wavelength shorter than $91.2  \ nm$ (far ultra-violet)

Massive main sequence stars have $T>30 000 \ K$ . Young stars are also still surrounded by dense $(10^{10} \ m^{-3})$ gas. This gives rise to ionized nebulae called $H \ II$ regions. The gas is hot $T~ 10 000 \ K$ and fluoresces.
