Relative motion is about how one object moves "as perceived by" another object.

For a moving reference frame,
$$\vec{v_{2}^{'}}=\vec{v_{2}}-\vec{{v_{1}}}$$

If a reference frame is not accelerating it is called an inertial reference frame. Acceleration, and therefore force, in an inertial reference frame is measured the same as static reference frame. The opposite is true is the reference frame is accelerating.
