If we want to use diffraction effects to study atomic/molecular materials the wavelength has to be of the order of typical distances between atoms/molecules. Typical inter-atomic distances are $0.1-1  \ \text{nm}$. Thus, x-rays are perfect for structure investigations of matter.



For constructive interference
$$n\lambda=2d\sin \theta$$
where $d$ is the distance between 2 lattice planes in a crystal.

A crystal which extends through a full specimen without interruption is called a single crystal. Most crystalline solids are composed of many small crystals or grains. These are called polycrystalline. The boundaries between the crystals, the so called grain boundaries can be very important for material behaviour.

Diffraction spots occur for the diffraction angles corresponding to fulfilled Bragg conditions for different lattice planes.

In the grains of the powder the crystalline directions with respect to the incoming x-ray beam vary, which leads to diffraction rings instead of diffraction spots and an efficient sampling of all diffraction conditions.

All crystals can be described by a Bravais lattice plus a basis (motif); the basis is applied to each Bravais lattice point. Not all crystals can be described by a Bravais lattice.

A Bravais lattice is an infinite array of points, where every point has the same environment, which consists of all points with position vectors $R$ of the form
$$R=n_{1}a_{1}+n_{2}a_{2}+n_{3}a_{3} \ \forall \ n_{i} \in \mathbb Z$$
The lattice is generated or spanned by the primitive vectors $a_{i}$ and there are an infinite number of choices for the primitive vectors $a_{i}$

The Bravais lattice can be divided into unit cells that span the lattice when translated. The (conventional) unit cell is a volume (3D) or area (2D) that fills space without overlapping or leaving voids when translated through some subset of lattice vectors of the Bravais lattice and is not unique

The primitive lattice is a volume (3D) or area (2D) that fills all of space without overlapping or leaving voids when translated  
through all the vectors in the Bravais lattice and is not unique  

Obvious choices are the points
$$r=x_{1}a_{1}+x_{2}a_{2}+x_{3}a_{3}$$
