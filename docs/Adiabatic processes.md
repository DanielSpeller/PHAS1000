In an adiabatic process,
$$Q_{in}=0$$
For an adiabatic process $\frac{dp}{dv}$ is greater than an isothermal process

Adiabatic expansion causes V to increase, P to reduce and T to reduce

Applying this to the [[1st Law of Thermodynamics|1st law of thermodynamics]]

$$Q_{in }=\Delta U+W$$
$$W=-\Delta U$$
$$W=-nc'_{v}\Delta T$$
$$W=-\frac{nc'_{v}}{nR}(p_{i}v_{i}-p_{t}v_{t})$$
$$W=-\frac{c'_{v}}{R}(p_{i}v_{i}-p_{t}v_{t})$$
Using Mayer's equation
$$c'_{p}-c'_{v}=R$$
$$\gamma=\frac{c'_{p}}{c'_{v}}$$
$$W=-\frac{1}{\gamma-1}(p_{i}v_{i}-p_{t}v_{t})$$


For adiabatic processes only
$$PV^{\gamma}$$
and 
$$TV^{\gamma-1}$$
A Carnot cycle, is the most efficient cycle in a system has 2 isothermal steps and 2 adiabatic steps.
$$Qin=\Delta U +W$$
Heat enters or leaves the gas in isothermal steps, temperature falls or rises in adiabatic steps and work is done in all steps
