Principal Quantum Numbers (n)
- Labels the atomic shell and is the same for all electrons within a shell  
- The farther an electron is from the nucleus the larger n is, n represents the shell size


The orbital quantum number $(l) = 0, 1, 2, 3, \dots n-1$ is related to the amplitude of the orbital angular momentum due to motion around the nucleus

The magnetic quantum number: $m_{l} =-l,-l+1, ..., +l$  is related to the projection of the orbital angular momentum on a chosen axis. Subshells with different $m_{l}$ differs in energy in a magnetic field.

The spin quantum number $m_{s} = +1/2, -1/2$ (spin up↑ or spin down ↑). $m_{s}$ relates to the electron’s intrinsic angular momentum - a quantum mechanical property

Pauli exclusion principle: only one electron is allowed in each state characterised by all four quantum numbers
