A Bipolar Junction Transistor is a semiconductor device, which acts as a switch or amplifier. It is made of two PN junctions and three regions:
- Emitter: Highly doped region that emits charge carriers
- Base: Thin, lightly doped region that controls carrier flow
- Collector: Moderately doped region that collects carrier from the emitter

An NPN transistor emits electrons as charge carriers whereas an PNP transistor emits holes as charge carriers

$$I_{E}=I_{B}+I_{C}$$
$$I_{C}=\beta I_{B}$$
BJT have three primary modes of operation:
- Cut-off mode: Both PN junctions are reverse biased, the transistor is off and no current flows
- Active Mode: The emitter based junction is forward biased and the collector base junction is reverse biased, the transistor acts an amplifier
- Saturation mode, both junctions are forward biased, the transistor is on and acts as a switch
