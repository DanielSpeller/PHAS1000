The amount of combinations of $n$ things out of a set of $k$ things is defined as $n$ choose $k$
$$\left(\begin{array}{r}n   \\
 k \end{array}\right)=\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$
The binomial function uses this concept as it is defined
$$(x+y)^n=\sum_{k=0}^n\left(\begin{array}{r}n   \\
 k \end{array}\right)x^{n-k}y^k$$
 We can also approximate functions with a Taylor series
 $$f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{f^k(a)}{k!}(x-a)^k$$
