Sources of uncertainties

- Instrumental limitations
- Systematic uncertainties
- Random uncertainties 

Whenever repeated measurements are taken, the spread is measured by the standard deviation

In the population
$$\sigma_{n}=\sqrt{ \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\bar{x}-x_{i})^2 }$$
In the sample
$$\sigma_{n-1}=\sqrt{ \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\bar{x}-x_{i})^2 }$$
Therefore the standard uncertainty is 
$$\alpha=\frac{\sigma_{n-1}}{\sqrt{ n }}$$
