#Thermal #PHAS1000 #Y1 
- Heat ($Q$) is a flow of energy caused by a temperature difference.

- Heat absorbed by an object is stored as internal energy ($U$).

- Internal energy is the kinetic energy and potential energy of the atoms or molecules

- Thermal equilibrium is when heat flow ceases


Zeroth law: If two objects are separately in thermal equilibrium with a third, then they are in thermal equilibrium with each other

Specific heat capacity is the heat needed to raise the temperature of 1kg by 1K
$$Q=mc\Delta t$$
Latent heat is the heat needed to change the phase
$$Q=ml$$
